# Monad Maybe in C

Languages like Haskell have monads that are able to operate context wrapping data and solving sequential problems.
The most famous monad is a Maybe Monad with this structure below:

Data Maybe x = Just x | Maybe

This project is an implementation of Maybe monad with monad interface in C language.

Of course, it's hurt a lot, anyway sorry for everything :)
