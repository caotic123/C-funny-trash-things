#Pessimist Search

Pessimist Search is a type of search that always stick in local solutions even if the search knows that somewhere there is a better solution, however the perbutation with a happy metaheuristic algorithm realize a break in "the rule" *no one place is better than i am here now*.

The "happy metaheuristic" instead of Pessimist Search always choose possibility than pessimist. So if the algorithm knows that have better solution it mess up with a pessimist search for maybe find out a global solution :D
