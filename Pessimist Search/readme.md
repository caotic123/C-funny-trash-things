# Pessimist Search

Pessimist Search is a type of search that always stick in local solutions even if the search knows that somewhere there is a better solution, however the perbutation with a happy metaheuristic algorithm made a break in "the rule" *no one place is better than i am here now*.

The "happy metaheuristic" instead of Pessimist Search always choose possibility than pessimist. So if the algorithm knows that have better solution it mess up with a pessimist search for maybe find out a global solution :D

# How Works

Let n...n' a list of agents and M a map (y x y) with three solutions (W M S) in order of max value, thus W is a minimum local, M a medium local and S is a global solution.

The agents has to find out a valid solution in the map. They always grip in some solution if they step in. Each floor is a list of Agents and maybe a solution, so we consider a perfect solution if ... N Of N Agents and S Solution in a F floor.
